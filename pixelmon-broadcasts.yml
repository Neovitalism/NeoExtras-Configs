# Welcome to the all-powerful custom broadcast system!
# This broadcast system allows you to specify pokemon down to the T in order to specify their messages and colours!
# You may add and remove as many broadcasts as you want. The spec parser does the rest.
#
# Supported identifier specs: (These must be seperated by a dash, and always lowercase.)
# - species:[speciesName]
# - form:[formName]
# - palette:[paletteName]
# - mythical (Mythicals also fire the legendary message, if you don't define mythical, or the pokemon doesn't fit the spec requirement.)
# - legendary (If you use mythical, legendary, or ultrabeast in the same identifier, it'll act as "OR".
# - ultrabeast
# - shiny
#
# Placeholders: - Spigot PAPI placeholders are also supported, but note: they will not parse if for some reason {player} fails.
# {player} - The name of the player responsible for the action. (Will be nearest player in some cases. If for some reason, this errors out, it'll put "a player")
# {pokemon} - The name of the pokemon specified in the action.
# {form} - The name of the pokemon's form. Form and Palette automatically put a space afterwards if they find a non-default value.
# {palette} - The name of the pokemon's palette.
# {ivs} - The pokemon's IV percentage out of 100. (##.##% format, not including the percent symbol.)
# {ivs_rounded} - The pokemon's IV percentage out of 100. (##% format, not including the percent symbol.)
# {n} - To be put after an "a" character. Changes the "a" to "an" if needbe.
#
# Spawning specific placeholders:
# {x} {y} {z} - The corresponding coordinate to the pokemon's location.
# {world} - The player's world at the time of the spawn. Returns "a world" if something goes wrong.
#
# You can test any broadcast by running '/testbroadcast [type] [specIdentifier]'. I.E. '/testbroadcast spawning shiny-ultrabeast'.
# The command sends the message both in-game and in discord. Placeholders will NOT parse.
# "show-player-avatar" will not work unless run by a player.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Cloning machine pokemon do not currenly work in spawning broadcasts. Bug report has been submitted.

priority: # This list determines what message the pokemon will use if it fits multiple categories. If you do not add it to this list, it will not be registered.
